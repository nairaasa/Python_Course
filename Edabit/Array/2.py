"""
In abstract set theory, a construction due to von Neumann represents the natural numbers by sets, as follows:

0 = [ ] is the empty set
1 = 0 ∪ [ 0 ] = [ 0 ] = [ [ ] ]
2 = 1 ∪ [ 1 ] = [ 0, 1 ] = [ [ ], [ [ ] ] ]
n = n−1 ∪ [ n−1 ] = ...
Write a function that receives an integer n and produces the representing set.

Examples
rep_set(0) ➞ []

rep_set(1) ➞ [[]]

rep_set(2) ➞ [[], [[]]]

rep_set(3) ➞ [[], [[]], [[], [[ ]]]]
Notes
Make sure to use list brackets [,].
Technically we should use set brackets {,} instead, but Python doesn't approve.
A neat feature of this representation is that n < m precisely if the set representing n is contained in the set representing m.
